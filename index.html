How to play:

Split into teams and get a timer ready.

The goal is to get your teammates to guess the word at the top of the card,
without saying any of the forbidden (or "taboo") words listed below.

Try for as many correct guesses as possible within the time allotted by the timer.
Each correct guess by your teammates wins your team a point!

Rules:
- You can't say any part of the words listed (e.g. if the word is "treehouse",
you can't say "tree".)
- You can only use words to describe things - no gesturing, pantomiming, drawing, or making noises (e.g. quacking)
